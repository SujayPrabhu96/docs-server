* The curl command adds the Couchbase Server's key and certificate by using the `--data-urlencode` argument to read them from the files `my_key.pem` and `my_certificate.crt`. 
* The _Fully Qualified Domain Name_ (FQDN) that users use to connect to the Web Console is `nodename.example.com`. Couchbase Server determines this value based on its own configuration.
* The IdP's metadata URL is `\https://myidp.com/sso/saml/metadata`. In this example, the metadata provides all the information Couchbase Server needs to configure the IdP. Therefore, the curl command has no further IdP parameters.
