See xref:learn:security/authentication-domains.adoc#saml-authentication[SAML Authentication] for an overview of SAML authentication. 

== Prerequisites

Before configuring SAML authentication consider the following:

Identity Provider::
SAML authentication relies on an _Identity Provider_ (IdP) to authenticate a user with the Couchbase Server Web Console. Couchbase Server supports the following IdPs:
+
* Okta
* Microsoft Azure AD
+
Note: Other IdPs may work. Couchbase Server was tested with the IdPs in the previous list.
+
Your IdP may have its own requirements for interacting with services like Couchbase Server. See your IdP's documentation to understand its requirements. 

Certificates::
 SAML authentication requires encryption. You need a key and certificate for your Couchbase cluster to use when encrypt and decrypt this data. You can use a unique certificate specifically for SAML authnetication. You can also use the same certificate you use for client authentication. 
 +
 Most IdPs expect certificates to be signed by a _Certificate Authority_ (CA) to verify authenticity. You can use a certificate signed by an intermediate certificate that was in turn signed by a CA if you also provide the intermediate certificate. For example, suppose your organization creates a certificate for you that they sign using a certificate signed by a CA. You can use this certificate with an IdP that requires CA-signed certificates by including a copy of the CA-signed certificate. The IdP uses the intermediate certificate to verify the authenticity of your cluster's certificate.
 + 
 You can supply Couchbase Server with a certificate to authenticate messages from and encrypt SAML messages to the IdP. Your IdP provides this certificate to you. 

Trusted Fingerprints::
Instead of using an IdP-provided certificate, you can choose to use trusted fingerprints for verifying the authenticity of an IdP SAML message. Using fingerprints reduces the overhead of verification. 

Network Configuration::
Some IdPs do not require a direct network connection to your Couchbase Server. Instead, the user's browser transmits the authentication request and response between Couchbase Server and the IdP. However, some IdPs may want to connect to services such as Couchbase Server to verify SAML metadata such as the certificate. This connection enables frequent key rotation, which helps increase security. Verify any inbound network connection requirements with your IdP. 
+
If you restrict your Couchbase cluster's access to the Internet, consider granting it access to the IdP. Allowing this connection makes SAML configuration easier and automates updating the IdP's certificates when they change due to key rotation.  

IdP Metadata::
Couchbase Server needs metadata about the IdP to be able to accept authentication messages from it. If your Couchbase Cluster can connect to the IdP, you can have it directly retrieve the IdP's metadata. See your IdP's documentation for this URL. You can configure Couchbase Server to periodically refresh this metadata to learn of changes to the IdP's configuration.
+
If Couchbase Server cannot connect to the IdP, you can upload a a file containing the metadata. 

Group and Roles Management::
Decide whether you'll manage group and role membership in Couchbase Server or in the IdP. If you decide to manage groups and roles in Couchbase Server, create Couchbase Server users in the external authentication realm. Assign these users the groups and roles they need. If you choose to manage groups and roles in the IdP, create SAML attributes that you'll map to Couchbase Server groups and roles. Edit the users in the IdP so their attributes reflect the groups and roles they need. 

NameID and User Identity::
Determine how your IdP identifies users who have authenticated with their service. The SAML authentication message sent from the IdP to Couchbase Server identify the user using a format called a NameID. The nameID format is a colon-delimited string. It can be one of the following:
+
* `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified` does not set a format for the user identity. It can be any text string. This is the most common value.
* `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress` sets the format to an email address.
* `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent` uses a unique identifier that remains constant across different IdPs and services.
* `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient` uses a unique but temporary identifier 
+
Instead of relying on the nameID, you can also have Couchbase Server get the username from an attribute in the SAML message. You may choose to use an attribute instead of the nameID if the IdP provides the user identity in a format that doesn't match Coucbase Server usernames. For example, suppose the IdP only supports identifying users using an email address instead of a username. In this case, you can have the IdP send the user's username in an attribute. Then configure Couchbase Server to extract the username from the attribute instead of using the nameID.

== Configure SAML with the UI

To configure SAML authentication using Web Console:

. In the navigation bar, click *Security*.
. In the navigation menu, click *SAML*.
. Turn on the *Enabled* toggle.
. Complete the following procedures to finish configuring SAML:
.. <<configure-couchbase-metadata>>
.. <<configure-the-idp>>
.. <<configure-single-sign-on>>

### Configure Couchbase Metadata

Under *Metadata*, enter information about your Couchbase Server and organization. Most of these fields supply contact information to your IdP and do not affect the authentication process. The exceptions are:

SP Entity ID::
A URL that identifies your Couchbase Server to the IdP. You add this URL to your IdP's configuration so it can identify which service the user is authenticating with. This field is optional. If you do not enter a value, Couchbase Server uses a URL based on the node's fully qualified domain name, port number, and the path to the metadata page (`/saml/metadata`). 
SP Base URL Type::
This option controls hostname in the URL that the IdP redirects the user's browser to after authentication. Choose this option based on how users access your Couchbase Server:
+
* *Node address* sends the user to the self-reported address of the node the user is logging into. 
* *Alternate node address* sends the user to the node's alternate address. See xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/connectivity.adoc#alternate-addresses[Alternate Addresses].
* *Custom URL* sends the user to the URL you enter in the *Custom URL* field which appear when you select this option. Select this option when users use some other URL when connecting to nodes in the cluster. For example, if you use a load balancer to redirect users to nodes, enter its URL here. 

Key and Certificates::
Add the Couchbase Server's private key and certificate. Either copy and paste their content or upload them by clicking bth:[Select File]. If the certificate was not signed directly by a CA, added any intermediate certificates in *Certificate chain*. 

### Configure the IdP

Under *Identity Provider Configuration*, enter the information for your IdP: 

Load IDP metadata from::
Choose to either provide the IdP's metadata URL or to upload a snapshot of its metadata in a file. If you provide a URL, you can have Couchbase Server refresh the metadata periodically.
Verify remote peer::
Select to enable verification of the IdP's certificate. If you enable this option, supply a copy of the IdP's certificate in *CA Certificates*.   
Validate metadata using trusted fingerprints::
Select to enable using fingerprints instead of a certificate to authenticate the metadata from the IdP. Select *Use trusted fingerprints for metadata bootstrap only* to limit using fingerprint verification to just the initial retrieval of the metadata. Select *Always use trusted fingerprints to validate signatures in SAML...* to use fingerprints for all SAML message validation instead of just metadata.
Trusted Fingerprints::
Add the IdP's trusted fingerprints if you are using them.

=== Configure Single Sign-On

Under the *Single Sign-On* section, configure how Couchbase Server and the IdP communicate abiut user authentication.

Authentication IDP Binding::
Logout IDP Binding::
Select *Post* if Couchbase Server should use POST messages to send authentication and logout requests to the Idp. Select *Redirect* if Chouchbase Server should use URL parameters instead.
Validate assertion signature::
Validate assertion envelope signature::
Select to have Couchbase verify the signature of either the SAML assertions or the entire SAML envelope the IdP sends. You should enable at least one form of signature validation based on how your IdP signs its messages.

NameID format::
Enter the format that the IdP uses to identify the user. You must enter a value here, even if you configure Couchbase Server to use an attribute for the username.

Username attribute::
Select if you want to use a SAML attribute for the username and enter the attribute's name in *Username attribute*. 

Groups attribute::
Select if you want the IdP to manage group membership. Enter the name of the attribute in the *Groups attribute* box. Enter the separator character in *Groups separator* if your IdP sends lists of groups in a string. If you want Couchbase Server to only consider a subset of the group names that the IdP sends it, enter a regular expression in *Groups filter*. Couchbase Server  only applies the groups whose names match the regular expression to the user. 

Roles attribute::
Select if you want the IdP to manage user roles. Works the same way that
